The program _ckjm_ calculates Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented metrics by processing the bytecode of compiled Java files. The program calculates for each class the following six metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer.

* WMC: Weighted methods per class
* DIT: Depth of Inheritance Tree
* NOC: Number of Children
* CBO: Coupling between object classes
* RFC: Response for a Class
* LCOM: Lack of cohesion in methods

In addition it also calculates for each class

* Ca: Afferent couplings
* NPM: Number of public methods
